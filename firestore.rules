/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all user-generated
 * data is stored within a private data tree specific to that user. A user has
 * full control over their own data but has absolutely no access (read or write)
 * to the data of any other user. The security model relies entirely on the

 * document path for authorization, which is simple, performant, and avoids
 * costly cross-document reads in rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is segregated by user under the top-level `/users`
 * collection. Each user's data, including their job applications and pipeline
 * stages, is nested hierarchically under their unique user ID:
 *   /users/{userId}
 *   /users/{userId}/jobApplications/{jobApplicationId}
 *   /users/{userId}/pipelineStages/{pipelineStageId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Path-Based Ownership: Authorization is determined solely by matching the
 *   `userId` in the document path with the authenticated user's UID. This
 *   eliminates the need for denormalized `ownerId` fields on documents.
 * - Public User Profiles: The top-level user document is readable by any
 *   authenticated user to allow for features like user search or profile
 *   viewing, but writable only by the owner.
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible to list documents in the top-level
 *   `/users` collection, preventing enumeration of application users.
 * - Default Deny: Access is denied by default. Permissions must be
 *   explicitly granted.
