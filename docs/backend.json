    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, following the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. Authorization Independence is achieved by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules, ensuring that operations are atomic and easier to debug. The design leverages structural segregation and access modeling to simplify security rules.\n\nJob Applications are stored under each user's document to enforce clear ownership. Pipeline Stages are also stored under the user document. This design uses path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/jobApplications/{jobApplicationId}`) for private data and hierarchical paths for user-owned entities. All documents in a collection share the same security requirements, and consistent patterns are used for authorization using path based ownership."
